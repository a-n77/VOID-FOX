VOIDFOX is a total visual overhaul for Firefox-based browsers,
 stripping away the bloat of modern UI in favor of a high-contrast,
 Tokyo-Night-inspired tactical HUD. It is designed for users who want
their browser to look less like a window and more like a terminal workstation.
Cureently its still in beta so expect issues and forgive me for it i am trying my best
to fix them.
NOTE:2 make the rice look complete i had 2 .js files but i forgot where they are rn i
will update once i find them
